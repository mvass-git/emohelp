    <h1 class="s">What is Emohelp?</h1>
    <p>
        Emohelp is a free website with a database of categorized materials and resources related to common critical conditions and issues.<br><br>
Here you can find support for what concerns or interests you, receiving recommendations in the form of links to articles, apps, movies, books, and even music.<br><br>
Our goal is to create a space where you can feel more comfortable with your problems and learn more about them through the collected materials.<br><br>
To determine your current most pressing condition, the site offers a short test.<br><br>
You can also browse the catalog and choose what interests you without taking the test.<br><br>
You can take the test multiple times.
    </p>

    <h1 class="s">Is it a professional mental help website?</h1>
    <p>
        Emohelp does not provide professional psychological assistance; it is only a resource for identifying your problematic states and providing materials from pop culture.<br><br>
The test result is not a diagnosis.<br><br>
For professional help, please consult a specialist.
    </p>

    <h1 class="s">About the test</h1>
